üîç **Image Loading Troubleshooting Guide**

## Issue Identified
The bread and banana images aren't showing because the API response is missing the `image` field in product objects.

## Root Cause
When I tested the API endpoint `/api/recommendations`, the response shows products without the `image` property:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "name": "Almond Milk",
      "reason": "You've bought milk before",
      "product": {
        "_id": "4",
        "name": "Almond Milk",
        "price": 3.99,
        "category": "dairy",
        "isSustainable": true,
        "ecoScore": 80
        // ‚ùå Missing "image" field
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expected Format
The API should return products with the `image` field:
```json
{
  "product": {
    "_id": "1",
    "name": "Organic Bananas",
    "price": 2.99,
    "category": "fruits",
    "isSustainable": true,
    "ecoScore": 85,
    "image": "/images/products/product-1-bananas.svg" // ‚úÖ Should be included
  }
}
```

## Quick Fix Applied
1. ‚úÖ Updated user.json to match exact product names
2. ‚úÖ Added debug logging to recommendation.js
3. ‚úÖ Image files exist in correct location: `frontend/public/images/products/`
4. ‚úÖ Images are accessible directly via browser

## Next Steps
1. Check backend logs for debug output
2. Verify recommendation algorithm is including image field
3. Test API response includes complete product data
4. Refresh frontend to use updated API data

## Status
üîß **IN PROGRESS** - Backend updated, testing image field inclusion in API response
