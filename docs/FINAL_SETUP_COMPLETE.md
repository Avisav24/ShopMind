- No external dependencies - all images load from your local project

### 📁 Files Updated

- ✅ `utils/mockData.js` - Updated with local image paths
- ✅ `simple-server.js` - Updated with local image paths
- ✅ `utils/recommendation.js` - Returns complete product data
- ✅ 12 SVG files created in `frontend/public/images/products/`
