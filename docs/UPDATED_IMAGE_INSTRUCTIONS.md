# Product Images Update - Local Images

## What's Changed

I've created and integrated custom SVG product images for the SmartCart-AI application. All images are now stored locally and will display reliably. The following changes have been made:

1. **Created local SVG images** - 12 custom product images in `frontend/public/images/products/`
2. **Updated mockData.js** - Changed image URLs to use local paths
3. **Updated simple-server.js** - Changed image URLs to use local paths
4. **Updated recommendation.js** - Returns complete product data including local images
5. **Updated Home.jsx** - Configured to display local product images

## Custom Product Images Created

✅ All 12 products now have custom SVG images:

- 🍌 Organic Bananas - Yellow gradient with banana emoji
- 🥛 Greek Yogurt - Light blue with white circle design
- 🍞 Whole Grain Bread - Brown gradient with bread shape
- 🥛 Almond Milk - Purple gradient with milk carton design
- 🍗 Organic Chicken - Pink gradient with meat shape
- 🌾 Brown Rice - Green gradient with rice grain dots
- 🥬 Fresh Spinach - Green gradient with leaf shapes
- 🌾 Quinoa - Yellow gradient with small grain dots
- 🥛 Milk - White/gray gradient with milk carton
- 🍞 Bread - Beige gradient with bread loaf
- 🧈 Butter - Yellow gradient with butter block
- 🥚 Eggs - Orange gradient with egg shapes

## How to Test the Changes

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run backend
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. You should now see beautiful custom product images in:
   - The Home page recommendations
   - Product details
   - Cart items

## Image Features

- **SVG Format**: Scalable vector graphics that look crisp at any size
- **Custom Designed**: Each image matches the product category with appropriate colors
- **Local Storage**: No external dependencies - images are stored in your project
- **Fast Loading**: Small file sizes for optimal performance
- **Consistent Style**: Unified design language across all products

## Troubleshooting

If images are still not displaying:

1. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5
2. **Check file paths** - Ensure all images exist in `frontend/public/images/products/`
3. **Verify both servers are running**:
   - Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. **Check browser console** for any errors
5. **Restart both servers** if needed
